No additional installation is required.\r\n\r\nYou can have more than one queue manager running on a single application. Manager instances will always select unique messages from queue.\r\nMessages that fail to execute (throws Exception) will stay in queue. Exception message can be viewed in queue manager.\r\nExecutor will try to execute failed message once again after timeout is reached.\r\n\r\nComponent does not handle dependencies with other messages. That means that message in a queue knows nothing about other messages in queue.\r\nFor those who searches for solution to this problem - Gearman is the way to go, but requires time for setup.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n=================\r\n\r\n* PHP >5.3\r\n* PDO\r\n* Database backend (sqlite, sqlite memory, mysql, postgres, any PDO supported database)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall with Composer\r\n=================\r\n\r\n* Install dependency\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"fordnox/php-queue-manager\": \"0.2\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Use included sqlite file (extra/queue.sqlite) for basic backend system to connect to via PDO\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$dbh = new PDO('sqlite:queue.sqlite');\r\n$dbh->setAttribute(\\PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, \\PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );\r\n$dbh->setAttribute(\\PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, \\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\r\n$dbh->exec($structure);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Queue\r\n=================\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\n$message = new \\QueueExample\\Dummy();\r\n\r\n$manager = new \\Queue\\Manager();\r\n$manager->setPdo($dbh);\r\n$manager->addMessageToQueue($message, 'AmazonEmailsQueue');\r\n\r\n// Usually this call should be executed via cron or some other worker\r\n$amazonEmails = $manager->getQueue('AmazonEmailsQueue');\r\n$amazonEmails->execute();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n=================\r\n\r\n- [ ] Write tests for all SQL backends\r\n- [ ] Create simple Web Interface","google":"UA-1553989-21","note":"Don't delete this file!
